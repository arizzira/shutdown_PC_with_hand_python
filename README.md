**Control your PC's power with a simple hand gesture.**  
No more clicking Start → Power → Shutdown. Just raise your hand (literally) and your system shuts down in style.

## 🎯 Overview

This project uses **MediaPipe** for real-time hand tracking combined with **OpenCV** to detect a specific gesture via your webcam. When the gesture is recognized, a shutdown command is sent to the operating system.

💡 *Think of it as a futuristic kill switch — but with style and zero extra hardware.*

Perfect for:
- 🎮 Gamers who want a quick way to shutdown during streaming
- 👨‍💻 Developers working on touchless interfaces
- 🔬 Anyone exploring computer vision applications
- 🚀 Tech enthusiasts who love sci-fi level control

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Webcam/Camera access
- Administrator privileges (for shutdown commands)

### Installation Steps

#### 1️⃣ **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/arizzira/shutdown_PC_with_hand_python.git
cd shutdown_PC_with_hand_python
```

#### 2️⃣ **Set Up Virtual Environment** (Recommended)
```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### 3️⃣ **Install Dependencies**
```bash
# Install required packages
pip install opencv-python mediapipe

# Or install from requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4️⃣ **Test Camera Access**
```bash
# Run a quick camera test first
python -c "import cv2; cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0); print('Camera OK' if cap.read()[0] else 'Camera Error'); cap.release()"
```

#### 5️⃣ **Launch the Application**
```bash
python Project.py
```

## 🔄 How It Works

    A[📹 Webcam Capture] --> B[🖐️ Hand Detection]
    B --> C[📍 Landmark Extraction]
    C --> D{🎯 Gesture Match?}
    D -->|Yes| E[⚠️ Confirmation Timer]
    D -->|No| A
    E --> F[💻 System Shutdown]
    E -->|Cancel| A
    G[⌨️ Press 'q'] --> H[🚪 Safe Exit]
```

</div>

### Detailed Process:

1. **📹 Video Input Capture**
   - OpenCV connects to your default webcam (index 0)
   - Streams real-time frames at optimal resolution

2. **🖐️ Hand Landmark Detection**
   - MediaPipe identifies 21 hand key points
   - Tracks fingertips, joints, and palm center coordinates

3. **🎯 Gesture Recognition**
   - Analyzes finger positions and orientations
   - Compares against predefined gesture pattern
   - Example gesture: Middle finger raised, others folded

4. **⚠️ Safety Confirmation**
   - Optional countdown timer before execution
   - Visual feedback on screen

5. **💻 Command Execution**
   - **Windows**: `shutdown /s /t 1`
   - **Linux**: `sudo shutdown now`
   - **macOS**: `sudo shutdown -h now`

---

## 🖐️ Gesture Configuration

### Default Gesture: "Stop" Hand
- **Palm**: Facing camera
- **Fingers**: All extended and separated
- **Duration**: Hold for 3 seconds
- **Distance**: 1-3 feet from camera

### Customizing Gestures

Edit the gesture detection logic in `Project.py`:

```python
def detect_shutdown_gesture(landmarks):
    # Example: Detect thumbs up
    thumb_tip = landmarks[4]
    thumb_mcp = landmarks[2]
    
    # Add your custom gesture logic here
    if thumb_tip.y < thumb_mcp.y:  # Thumb pointing up
        return True
    return False
```

## ⚠️ Safety & Important Warnings

<div align="center">

| ⚠️ **CRITICAL SAFETY NOTICES** |
|---|

</div>

- 🚨 **Instant Shutdown**: Once gesture is detected, shutdown happens **immediately**
- 💾 **Save Your Work**: Always save important files before testing
- 🧪 **Test Mode**: Comment out shutdown command during development
- 👤 **Admin Rights**: Linux/macOS require sudo privileges
- 📷 **Camera Privacy**: Ensure you're comfortable with camera access

### Safe Testing Method:
```python
# Replace shutdown command with print statement for testing
# os.system("shutdown /s /t 1")  # Comment this out
print("SHUTDOWN TRIGGERED!")  # Use this instead
```

---

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Camera Settings
```python
# In Project.py, modify these values:
CAMERA_INDEX = 0        # Change if using external webcam
FRAME_WIDTH = 640       # Adjust for performance
FRAME_HEIGHT = 480      # Adjust for performance
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.8  # Gesture detection sensitivity
```

### Gesture Sensitivity
```python
GESTURE_HOLD_TIME = 3.0    # Seconds to hold gesture
CONFIRMATION_DELAY = 5.0   # Countdown before shutdown
```

## 🐞 Troubleshooting Guide

<details>
<summary><strong>📷 Camera Issues</strong></summary>

**Problem**: Camera not detected or black screen

**Solutions**:
- Check if another application is using the webcam
- Try different camera indices (0, 1, 2, etc.)
- Verify camera permissions in system settings
- Test with: `python -c "import cv2; print(cv2.VideoCapture(0).read())"`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🖐️ Gesture Recognition Problems</strong></summary>

**Problem**: Gestures not being recognized

**Solutions**:
- Ensure adequate lighting (avoid backlighting)
- Position hand 1-3 feet from camera
- Make gestures slow and deliberate
- Clean camera lens
- Adjust `CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` value

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>💻 Shutdown Command Issues</strong></summary>

**Problem**: Shutdown command doesn't execute

**Solutions**:
- **Windows**: Run as Administrator
- **Linux/macOS**: Check sudo permissions
- **macOS**: Grant terminal full disk access in Privacy settings
- Test command manually in terminal first

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🐍 Python Environment Issues</strong></summary>

**Problem**: Import errors or module not found

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Reinstall packages
pip uninstall opencv-python mediapipe
pip install opencv-python mediapipe

# Check Python version
python --version  # Should be 3.8+

# Verify installations
python -c "import cv2, mediapipe; print('All imports successful')"
```
